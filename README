This is my first interaction with an API. This allows the user to see data from the
Star Wars API, to see a list of Characters, Films or Vehicles, and then to view
details on any of those. It's a simple interface in Terminal.

On the detail output, I wrote a long detailed output for the Film detail, and then
wrote a short, reusable FOR loop for Films and Vehicles. This was partially because
that worked best for the material and partially to demonstrate I could do both.
